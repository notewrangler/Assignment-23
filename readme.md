Using React, build a Todo application. The application should allow you to enter in new todo items (text), and list those todo items out immediately below and have it be available again when you refresh your page.


* Replicate the following behavior using React.
* You should be able to mark an item as completed.
* You should be able to remove an item from the list (completed or not).
* You should store all todos in a parse.com database and load them on page load.

## Hard Mode
* You should add filters for 
  - All Items (completed or not)
  - Completed items
  - Active items 
* You should have a button to remove all completed items from the list.
